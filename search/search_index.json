(We will describe in more detail some of the Phase Modules in the next section). The MindsDB Stack DataExtractor It deals with extracting inputs from various data-sources such as files, directories and SQL compatible databases. If input is a query, it builds the joins with all implied tables (if any). StatsLoader : There is some transaction such as PREDICT where it's assumed that the statistical information is already known, all we have to do is make sure we load the right statistics to the transaction BUS. At the moment we don't support loading database from {char}svs that don't have headers or have incomplete headers. NOTE : That as of now mindsDB requires that the full dataset can be loaded into memory, in the future we might look into supporting very large datasets using something like apache drill to query a FS or db for the chunks of data we need in order to train and generate our statistical analysis . StatsGenerator Once the data is pulled and aggregated from the various data sources, MindsDB runs an analysis of each of the columns of the corpus. The purpose of the stats generator is two fold: To provide various data quality scores in order to determine the overall quality of a column (e.g. variance, some correlation metrics between columns, amount of duplicates). To provide properties about the columns which have to be used in the following steps and in order to rain the model. (e.g. histogram, data type) After all stats are computed, we warn the user of any interesting insights we found about his data and (if web logs are enabled), use the generated values to plot some interesting information about the data (e.g. data type distribution, outliers, histogram). Finally, the various stats are passed on as part of the metadata, so that further phases and the model itself can use them. Model Interface Train mode : When calling learn ,the model interface will feed the data to a machine learning framework which does the training in order to build a model. Predict mode : When calling predict , the model interface will feed the data to the model built by learn in order to generate a prediction. Data adaption : The ModelInterface phase is simply a lightweight wrapper over the model backends which handle adapting the data frame used by mindsdb into a format they can work with. During this process additional metadata for the machine learning libraries/frameworks is generated based on the results of the Stats Generator phase. Learning backend : The learning backends as the ensemble learning libraries used by mindsdb to train the model that will generate the predictions. Currently the learning backend we are working on supporting is Lightwood (created by us, based on the pre 1.0 version of mindsdb, work in progress). ModelAnalyzer The model analyzer phase runs after training is done in order to gather insights about the model and gather insights about the data that we can only get post-training. At the moment, it contains the fitting for a probabilistic model which is used to determine the accuracy of future prediction, based on the number of missing features and the bucket in which the predicted value falls.","title":"Inside MindsDB"},{"location":"InsideMindsDB/#the-mindsdb-stack","text":"","title":"The MindsDB Stack"},{"location":"InsideMindsDB/#dataextractor","text":"It deals with extracting inputs from various data-sources such as files, directories and SQL compatible databases.

Predictor Note: The Predictor in MindsDB's words means Machine Learning Model. Constructor predictor = Predictor(name='weather_forecast') Constructs a new mindsdb predictor name -- Required argument, the name of the predictor, used for saving the predictor, creating a new predictor with the same name as a previous one loads the data from the old predictor root_folder -- The directory (also known as folder) where the predictor information should be saved log_level -- The log level that the predictor should use, number from 0 to 50, with 0 meaning log everything and 50 meaning log only fatal errors: DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL = 10 INFO_LOG_LEVEL = 20 WARNING_LOG_LEVEL = 30 ERROR_LOG_LEVEL = 40 NO_LOGS_LOG_LEVEL = 50 Learn predictor.learn(from_data=a_data_source, to_predict='a_column') Teach the predictor to make predictions on a given dataset, extract information about the dataset and extract information about the resulting machine learning model making the predictions. This is the \"main\" functionality of mindsdb_native together with the \"predict\" method. from_data -- the data that you want to use for training, this can be either a file, a pandas data frame, a url or a mindsdb data source. to_predict -- The columns/keys to be predicted (aka the targets, output columns, target variables), can be either a string (when specifying a single column) or a list of strings (when specifying multiple columns). test_from_data -- Specify a different data source on which mindsdb should test the machine learning model, by default mindsdb_native takes testing and validation samples from your dataset to use during training and analysis, and only trains the predictive model on ~80% of the data. This might seem sub-optimal if you're not used to machine learning, but trust us, it allows us to have much better confidence in the model we give you. timeseries specific parameters : group_by, window_size, order_by -- For more information on how to use these, please see the advanced examples section dealing with timeseries . Please note, these are currently subject to change, though they will remain backwards compatible until v2.0. ignore_columns -- Ignore certain columns from your data entirely. stop_training_in_x_seconds -- Stop training the model after this amount of seconds, note, the full amount it takes for mindsdb_native to run might be up to twice the amount you specify in this value. Thought, usually, the model training constitutes ~70-90% of the total mindsdb_native runtime. stop_training_in_accuracy -- Deprecated argument, left for backwards compatibility, to be removed or revamped in v2.0, refrain from using, it has no effects. backend -- The machine learning backend to use in order to train the model. This can be a string equal to lightwood (default) or ludwig , this can also be a custom model object. rebuild_model -- Defaults to True , if this is set to False the model will be loaded and the model analysis and data analysis will be re-run, but a new model won't be trained. use_gpu -- Defaults to None (autodetect), set to True if you have a GPU and want to make sure it's used or to False if you want to train the model on the CPU, this will speed up model training a lot in most situations. Note, that the default learning backend (lightwood) only work with relatively new (2016+) GPUs. equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories -- When you have unbalanced target variable values, this will treat all of them as equally important when training the model. To see more information about this and an example, please see advanced section . output_categories_importance_dictionary -- A dictionary containing a number representing the importance for each (or some) values from the column to be predicted. An example of how his can be used (assume the column we are predicting is called is_true and takes two falues): {'is_true': {'True':0.6, 'False':1}} . The bigger the number (maximum value is one), the more important will it be for the model to predict that specific value correctly (usually at the cost of predicting other values correctly and getting more false positives for that value). advanced_args -- A dictionary of advanced arguments. Includes force_disable_cache , force_categorical_encoding , handle_foreign_keys , use_selfaware_model , deduplicate_data . sample_settings -- A dictionary of options for sampling from the dataset. Includes sample_for_analysis . sample_for_training , sample_margin_of_error , sample_confidence_level , sample_percentage , sample_function . If you are interested in using advanced_args or sample_settings but you are unsure of how they work, please shot us an email or create a github issue and we will help you. Predict predict(self, when_data = None, update_cached_model = False, use_gpu=False, advanced_args={}, backend=None, run_confidence_variation_analysis=False): predictor.predict(from_data=the_data_source) Make a prediction about a given dataset. when_data -- the data that you want to make the predictions for, this can be either a file, a pandas data frame, a url, a dictionary used for single prediction(column name: value) or a mindsdb data source. update_cached_model -- Deprecated argument, left for backwards compatibility, to be removed or revamped in v2.0, refrain from using, it has no effects. use_gpu -- Defaults to None (autodetect), set to True if you have a GPU and want to make sure it's used or to False if you want to train the model on the CPU, this will speed up model training a lot in most situations. Note, that the default learning backend (lightwood) only work with relatively new (2016+) GPUs. advanced_args -- A dictionary of advanced arguments. Includes force_disable_cache . backend -- The machine learning backend to use in order to train the model. This can be a string equal to lightwood (default) or ludwig , this can also be a custom model object. Note, you shouldn't use a different backend than the one you used to train the model, this will result in undefined behavior in the worst case scenario and most likely lead to a weired error.

Models With libraries such as Tensorflow, Sklearn, Pytorch you must have the expertise to build models from scratch. Your models are also black boxes, you can't be sure how or why they work and you have to pre-process your data in a format that's suitable for the model and look for any errors in the data yourself. With Mindsdb anyone can build state of the art models without any machine learning knowledge. Mindsdb also provides data extraction, analyses your input data and analyses the resulting model to try and understand what makes it work and what types of situations it works best in. Data Preprocessing Building models require time for cleaning the data, normalizing the data, converting it into the format your library uses, determining the type of data in each column and a proper encoding for it Mindsdb can read data from csv, json, excel, file urls, s3 objects , dataframes and relational database tables or queries (currently there's native support for maraiadb, mysql and postgres), you just need to tell it which colum(s) it should predict. It will automatically process the data for you and give insights about the data. Code Samples We are going to use home_rentals.csv dataset for comparison purpose. Inside the dataset dir, you can find the dataset split into train and test data. Our goal is to predict the rental_price of the house given the information we have in home_rental.csv . We will look at doing this with Sklearn, Tensorflow, Ludwig and Mindsdb. Sklearn is a generic easy-to-use machine learning library. Tensorflow is the state of the art deep learning model building library from google. Ludwig is a library from Uber that aims to help people build machine learning models without knowledge of machine learning (similar to mindsdb) Building the model Now we will build the actual models to train on the training dataset and run some predictions on the testing dataset. For the purpose of this example, we'll build a simple linear regression with both Tensorflow and Sklearn, in order to keep the code to a minimum.

Lastly, Mindsdb Studio provides you with an easy way to visiualize more insights about the model. This can also be done by calling mdb.get_model_data('model_name') , but it's easier to use Mindsdb Studio to visualize the data, rather than looking at the raw json. Comparing Mindsdb accuracy with state-of-the-art models We have a few example datasets where we try to compare the accuracy obtained by Mindsdb with that of the best models we could find. It should be noted, Mindsdb accuracy doesn't always beat or match stat-of-the-art models, but the main goal of Mindsdb is to learn quickly, be very easy to use and be adaptable on any dataset. If you have the time and know-how to build a model that performs better than Mindsdb, but you still want the insights into the model and the data, as well as the pre-processing that Mindsdb provides, you can always plug in a custom machine learning model into Mindsdb. We are currently creating a new Benchmarks repository where you can find detailed list with up to date examples. Untill we release that you can check the old list of accuracy comparisons on our examples repo and public benchmarks . Each directory containes different examples, datasets and README.md . To see the accuracies and the models, simply run mindsdb_acc.py to run mindsdb on the dataset. At some point we might keep a more easy to read list of these comparisons, but for now the results change to often and there are too many models to make this practical to maintain. We invite anyone with an interesting dataset and a well performing models to send it to us, or contribute to this repository, so that we can see how mindsdb stands up to it (or try it themselves and tell us the results they got).","title":"Comparison with other Libraries"},{"location":"comparisons/ComparsionWithOtherLibraries/#models","text":"With libraries such as Tensorflow, Sklearn, Pytorch you must have the expertise to build models from scratch.

AITables example AITables differ from normal tables in that they can generate predictions upon being queried and returning such predictions like if it was data that existed on the table. Simply put, an AI-Table allows you to use machine learning models as if they were normal database tables, in something that in plain SQL looks like this; SELECT < predicted_variable > FROM < ML_model > WHERE < conditions > To really sink in this idea, let us expand the concept through an example. The used car price example Imagine that you want to solve the problem of estimating the right price for a car on your website that has been selling used cars over the past 2 years. The data is persistend in your database inside a table called used_cars_data where you keep records of every car you have sold so far, storing information such as: price, transmission, mileage, fuel_type, road_tax, mpg (Miles Per Gallon) and engine_size. Since you have historical data, you know that you could use Machine Learning to solve this problem. Wouldn't it be nice if you could simply tell your database server to do and manage the Machine Learning parts for you? At MindsDB we think so too! And AI-Tables baked directly to your database are here to do exactly that. You can for instance with a single INSERT statement, create a machine learning model/predictor trained to predict \u2018price\u2019 using the data that lives in the table sold_cars and publish it as an AI-Table called 'used_cars_model'. INSERT INTO mindsdb . predictors ( name , predict , select_data_query ) VALUES ( 'used_cars_model' , 'price' , ' SELECT * FROM used_cars_data ); After that you can get price predictions by querying the generated 'used_cars_model' AI-Table, as follows: SELECT price , confidence FROM mindsdb . used_cars_model WHERE model = \"a6\" AND mileage = 36203 AND transmission = \"automatic\" AND fueltype = \"diesel\" AND mpg = \"64.2\" AND enginesize = 2 AND year = 2016 AND tax = 20 ; As you can see with AI-Tables, we are aiming to simplify Machine Learning mechanics to simple SQL queries, so that you can focus on the important part; which is to think about what predictions you need and what data you want your ML to learn from to make such predictions.

Make it so flexible that you can change and customize everything. Lightwood was inspired on Keras + Ludwig but runs on Pytorch and gives you full control of what you can do. Prerequisites Python >=3.6 64bit version Installing Lightwood You can install Lightwood using pip : pip3 install lightwood If this fails, please report the bug on github and try installing the current master branch: git clone git@github.com:mindsdb/lightwood.git ; cd lightwood ; pip install --no-cache-dir -e . Please note that, depending on your os and python setup, you might want to use pip instead of pip3 . You need python 3.6 or higher. Note on MacOS, you need to install libomp: brew install libomp Install using virtual environment We suggest you to install Lightwood on a virtual environment to avoid dependency issues. Make sure your Python version is >=3.6. To set up a virtual environment: Install on Windows Install the latest version of pip : python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip --version Activate your virtual environment and install lightwood: py -m pip install --user virtualenv . \\e nv \\S cripts \\a ctivate pip install lightwood You can also use python instead of py Install on Linux or macOS Before installing Lightwood in a virtual environment you need to first create and activate the venv : python -m venv env source env/bin/activate pip install lightwood Quick example Assume that you have a training file (sensor_data.csv) such as this one. sensor1 sensor2 sensor3 1 -1 -1 0 1 0 -1 -1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 -1 1 -1 0 0 0 -1 -1 1 1 0 0 And you would like to learn to predict the values of sensor3 given the readings in sensor1 and sensor2 . Learn You can train a Predictor as follows: from lightwood import Predictor import pandas sensor3_predictor = Predictor ( output = [ 'sensor3' ]) sensor3_predictor . learn ( from_data = pandas . read_csv ( 'sensor_data.csv' )) Predict You can now be given new readings from sensor1 and sensor2 predict what sensor3 will be. prediction = sensor3_predictor . predict ( when = { 'sensor1' : 1 , 'sensor2' : - 1 }) print ( prediction ) Of course, that example was just the tip of the iceberg, please read below about the main concepts of lightwood, the API and then jump into examples. Lightwood Predictor API from lightwood import Predictor Lightwood has one main class; The Predictor , which is a modular construct that you can train and get predictions from. It is made out of 3 main building blocks ( features, encoders, mixers ) that you can configure, modify and expand as you wish. Building blocks Features : input_features : These are the columns in your dataset that you want to take as input for your predictor. output_features : These are the columns in your dataset that you want to learn how to predict. Encoders : These are tools to turn the data in your input or output features into vector/tensor representations and vice-versa. Mixers : How you mix the output of encoded features and also other mixers Constructor, __init__() my_predictor = Predictor ( output = [] | config = { ... } | load_from_path =< file_path > ) Predictor, can take any of the following arguments load_from_path : If you have a saved predictor that you want to load, just give the path to the file output : A list with the column names you want to predict. ( Note: If you pass this argument, lightwood will simply try to guess the best config possible ) config : A dictionary, containing the configuration on how to glue all the building blocks. config The config argument allows you to pass a dictionary that defines and gives you absolute control over how to build your predictive model. A config example goes as follows: from lightwood import COLUMN_DATA_TYPES , BUILTIN_MIXERS , BUILTIN_ENCODERS config = { ## REQUIRED: 'input_features' : [ # by default each feature has an encoder, so all you have to do is specify the data type { 'name' : 'sensor1' , 'type' : COLUMN_DATA_TYPES . NUMERIC }, { 'name' : 'sensor2' , 'type' : COLUMN_DATA_TYPES . NUMERIC }, # some encoders have attributes that can be specified on the configuration # in this particular lets assume we have a photo of the product, we would like to encode this image and optimize for speed { 'name' : 'product_photo' , 'type' : COLUMN_DATA_TYPES . IMAGE , 'encoder_class' : BUILTIN_ENCODERS . Image . Img2VecEncoder , # note that this is just a class, you can build your own if you wish 'encoder_attrs' : { 'aim' : 'speed' # you can check the encoder attributes here: # https://github.com/mindsdb/lightwood/blob/master/lightwood/encoders/image/img_2_vec.py } } ], 'output_features' : [ { 'name' : 'action_to_take' , 'type' : COLUMN_DATA_TYPES . CATEGORICAL } ], ## OPTIONAL 'mixer' : { 'class' : BUILTIN_MIXERS . NnMixer } } features Both input_features and output_features configs are simple dicts that have the following schema name : is the name of the column as it is in the input data frame type : is the type of data contained. Where out of the box, supported COLUMN_DATA_TYPES are NUMERIC, CATEGORICAL, DATETIME, IMAGE, TEXT, TIME_SERIES : If you specify the type, lightwood will use the default encoder for that type, however, you can specify/define any encoder that you want to use. encoder_class : This is if you want to replace the default encoder with a different one, so you put the encoder class there encoder_attrs : These are the attributes that you want to setup on the encoder once the class its initialized mixer The default_mixer key, provides information as to what mixer to use. The schema for this variable is as follows: mixer_schema = Schema ({ 'class' : object , Optional ( 'attrs' ): dict }) class : It's the actual class, that defines the Mixer, you can use any of the BUILTIN_MIXERS or pass your own. attrs : This is a dictionary containing the attributes you want to replace on the mixer object once its initialized. We do this, so you have maximum flexibility as to what you can customize on your Mixers. learn() This method is used to make the predictor learn from some data, thus the learn method takes the following arguments. from_data : A pandas dataframe, that has some or all the columns in the config. The reason why we decide to only support pandas dataframes, its because, its easy to load any data to a pandas dataframe, and spark for python dataframe is a format we support. test_data : (Optional) This is if you want to specify what data to test with, if no test_data passed, lightwood will break the from_data into test and train automatically. callback_on_iter : (Optional) This is function callback that is called every 100 epochs during the learn process. predict() This method is used to make predictions and it can take one of the following arguments when : this is a dictionary of conditions to predict under. when_data : Sometimes you want to predict more than one row at a time, so here it is: a pandas dataframe containing the conditional values you want to use to make a prediction. save() Use this method to save the predictor into a desired path calculate_accuracy() Returns the predictors overall accuracy.","title":"Introduction to Lightwood"},{"location":"lightwood/info/#prerequisites","text":"Python >=3.6 64bit version","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"lightwood/info/#installing-lightwood","text":"You can install Lightwood using pip : pip3 install lightwood If this fails, please report the bug on github and try installing the current master branch: git clone git@github.com:mindsdb/lightwood.git ; cd lightwood ; pip install --no-cache-dir -e .

If you found missing feature or something isn't working please reach out to us on the Python SDK or JS SDK repositories. MindsDB Server Note that to use MindsDB SDK, you will need to have MindsDB Server started so you can connect to it. The MindsDB SDK's are providing all of the MindsDB's native functionalities through MindsDB HTTP Interface. Currently, MindsDB provides SDK's for Python and JavaScript. Installing Python SDK The Python SDK can be installed from PyPI: pip install mindsdb_sdk Or you can install it from source: git clone git@github.com:mindsdb/mindsdb_python_sdk.git cd mindsdb_python_sdk python setup.py develop pip install -r requirements.txt Connect to your data DataSources make it very simple to connect MindsDB to your data. Datasource can be: File(csv, tsv, json, xslx, xls) Pandas dataframe MindsDB datasource that is an enriched version of a pandas dataframe. MindsDB datasource could be MariaDB, Snowflake, S3, Sqlite3, Redshift, PostgreSQL, MsSQL, MongoDB, GCS, Clickhouse, AWS Athena. For more info please check the full list of datasource implementation here . Create new datasource from local file Before you train new model you need to create a datasource, so MindsDB can ingest and prepare the data. The following example use Medical Cost dataset . Let's load the local file as an pandas dataframe and create new datasource: from mindsdb_sdk import SDK # import SDK import pandas as pd # import pandas mindsdb_sdk = SDK ( 'http://localhost:47334' ) # Connect to MindsDB Server URL datasources = mindsdb_sdk . datasources df = pd . read_csv ( 'datasets/insurance.csv' ) # read the dataset datasources [ 'health_insurance' ] = { 'df' : df } # create new datasource To check that the datasource was succesfully created, you can call the list_info() method from datasources: datasources . list_info () This will return the info for each datasource as the following example: { ' na me' : 'heal t h_i nsuran ce' , 'source_ t ype' : ' f ile' , 'source' : '/mi n dsdb/var/da tas ources/heal t h_i nsuran ce/' , 'missed_ f iles' : No ne , 'crea te d_a t ' : ' 2021-02-19 T 14 : 20 : 57.860292 ' , 'upda te d_a t ' : ' 2021-02-19 T 14 : 20 : 57.908497 ' , 'row_cou nt ' : 27 , 'colum ns ' : [{ ' na me' : 'age' , ' t ype' : No ne , ' f ile_ t ype' : No ne , 'dic t ' : No ne } ... o t her colum ns } Train new model The learn method is used to make the predictor learn from the data. The required arguments to learn from data are model_name , target_variable , datasource . The following example train new model called insurance_model that predicts the charges from health_insurance datasource. model = mindsdb_sdk . predictors model . learn ( 'insurance_model' , 'charges' , 'health_insurance' ,) Query the model To get the predictons from the model use the predict method. This method is used to make predictions and it can take when_data argument. This can be file, dataframe or url or if you want to make the single predicton as in the following example use a dictionary. model . predict ( when_data = { 'age' : 30 , 'bmi' : 22 }) Usage example The following example trains new model from home_rentals dataset and predicts the rental price. from mindsdb_sdk import SDK # connect mdb = SDK ( 'http://localhost:47334' ) # upload datasource mdb . datasources [ 'home_rentals_data' ] = { 'file' : 'home_rentals.csv' } # create a new predictor and learn to predict predictor = mdb . predictors . learn ( name = 'home_rentals' , datasource = 'home_rentals_data' , to_predict = 'rental_price' ) # predict result = predictor . predict ({ 'initial_price' : '2000' , 'number_of_bathrooms' : '1' , 'sqft' : '700' }) Installing JavaScript SDK The JavaScript SDK can be installed with npm or yarn: npm install mindsdb-js-sdk or yarn add mindsdb-js-sdk Also, you can install it from source: git clone git@github.com:mindsdb/mindsdb_js_sdk.git cd mindsdb_js_sdk npm install Usage example The following example covers the basic flow: connect to MindsDB Server, train new model, make predictions. import MindsDB from 'mindsdb-js-sdk' ; //connection MindsDB . connect ( url ); const connected = await MindsDB . ping (); if ( ! connected ) return ; // lists of predictors and datasources const predictorsList = MindsDB . dataSources (); const predictors = MindsDB . predictors (); // get datasource const rentalsDatasource = await MindsDB .

In this tutorial you will learn how to use SQL queries to train a machine learning model and make predictions in three simple steps: Connect a database with customers' data to MindsDB. Use an INSERT statement to train the machine learning model automatically. Query predictions with a simple SELECT statement from MindsDB \"AI Table\" (this special table returns data from an ML model upon being queried). Using SQL to perform machine learning at the data layer will bring you many benefits like removing unnecessary ETL-ing, seamless integration with your data, and enabling predictive analytics in your BI tool. Let's see how this works with real world example to predict the probability of churn for a new customer of a telecom company. Note that you can follow up on this tutorial by connecting to your own database and using different data - the same workflow applies to most machine learning use cases. Pre-requisites First, make sure you have succesfully installed MindsDB. Check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi install. Second, you will need to have mysql-client or DBeaver, MySQL WOrkbench etc installed locally to connect to MySQL API. Database Connection First, we need to connect MindsDB to the database where the Customer Churn data is stored. In the left navigation click on Database. Next, click on the ADD DATABASE. Here, we need to provide all of the required parameters for connecting to the database. Supported Database - select the database that you want to connect to Integrations Name - add a name to the integration Database - the database name Host - database host name Port - database port Username - database user Password - users password Then, click on CONNECT. Create Datasource We have successfully connected MindsDB to the database. Now, we need to create a datasource which requires that we connect MindsDB to the Customer Churn table. Click on the NEW DATASET and add: Datasource Name - the name of the new source you are creating Database - the name of the database to connect Query - SELECT statement to select the data from database e.g SELECT * FROM table_name; After filling in all the values click on CREATE. Now, we have successfully created a new Datasource that is connected to the database. The next step is to use the MySQL client to connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API and train a new model to help us predict customer churn. Connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API I will use mysql command line client in the next part of the tutorial but you can follow up with the one that works the best for you, like MySQL Workbench, Dbeaver, etc. The first step we need to do is to use the MindsDB Cloud user to connect to the MySQL API: mysql -h cloud-mysql.mindsdb.com --port 3306 -u theusername@mail.com -p In the above command, we specify the hostname and user name explicitly, as well as a password for connecting. If you got the above screen that means you have successfully connected. If you have an authentication error, please make sure you are providing the email you have used to create an account on MindsDB Cloud. Data Overview In this tutorial, we will use the customer churn data-set. Each row represents a customer and we will train a machine learning model to help us predict if the customer is going to stop using the company products. Below is a short description of each feature inside the data. CustomerId - Customer ID Gender - Male or Female customer SeniorCitizen - Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (1, 0) Partner - Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No) Dependents - Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No) Tenure - Number of months the customer has stayed with the company PhoneService - Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No) MultipleLines - Whether the customer has multiple lines or not (Yes, No, No phone service) InternetService - Customer\u2019s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No) OnlineSecurity - Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No internet service) OnlineBackup - Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No internet service) DeviceProtection - Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service) TechSupport - Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet service) StreamingTv - Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service) StreamingMovies - Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No internet service) Contract - The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year) PaperlessBilling - Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No) PaymentMethod - The customer\u2019s payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic)) MonthlyCharges - The monthly charge amount TotalCharges - The total amount charged to the customer Churn - Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No). This is what we want to predict. Using SQL Statements to train/query models Now, we will train a new machine learning model from the datasource we have created using MindsDB Studio. Switch back to mysql-client and run: use mindsdb; show tables; You will notice there are 2 tables available inside the MindsDB database. To train a new machine learning model we will need to INSERT a new record inside the predictors table as: INSERT INTO mindsdb . predictors ( name , predict , external_datasource , training_options ) VALUES ( 'model_name' , 'target_variable' , 'datasource_name' , {\u201c ignore_columns \u201d : [] } ); The required values that we need to provide are: name (string) - The name of the model predict (string) - The feature you want to predict external_datasource (string) - The datasource name that we have created using MindsDB Studio training_options (JSON as comma separated string) - optional value that contains additional training parameters. The full list with parameters can be found at PredictorInterface docs . To train the model that will predict customer churn run: INSERT INTO mindsdb . predictors ( name , predict , external_datasource , training_options ) VALUES ( 'churn_model' , 'Churn' , 'CustomerChurnData' , '{\"ignore_columns\": [\"gender\"]}' ); What we did here was to create a model called customer_churn to predict the Churn and also ignore the gender column as an irrelevant column for the model. Also note that the ID columns in this case customerId will be automatically detected by MindsDB and ignored. The model training has started. To check if the training has finished you can SELECT the model name from the predictors table: SELECT * FROM predictors WHERE name = 'churn_model' ; The complete status means that the model training has successfully finished. The next steps would be to query the model and predict the customer churn. Let\u2019s be creative and imagine a customer. Customer will use only DSL service, no phone service and multiple lines, she was with the company for 1 month and has a partner. Add all of this information to the WHERE clause. SELECT Churn , Churn_confidence , Churn_explain as Info FROM customer_churn WHERE when_data = '{\"SeniorCitizen\": 0, \"Partner\": \"Yes\", \"Dependents\": \"No\", \"tenure\": 1, \"PhoneService\": \"No\", \"MultipleLines\": \"No phone service\", \"InternetService\": \"DSL\"}' ; With the confidence of around 82% MindsDB predicted that this customer will churn. One important thing to check here is the important_missing_information value, where MindsDB is pointing to the important missing information for giving a more accurate prediction, in this case, Contract, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges and OnlineBackup. Let\u2019s include those values in the WHERE clause, and run a new query: SELECT Churn , Churn_confidence , Churn_explain as Info FROM customer_churn WHERE when_data = '{\"SeniorCitizen\": 0, \"Partner\": \"Yes\", \"Dependents\": \"No\", \"tenure\": 1, \"PhoneService\": \"No\", \"MultipleLines\": \"No phone service\", \"InternetService\": \"DSL\", \"OnlineSecurity\": \"No\", \"OnlineBackup\": \"Yes\", \"DeviceProtection\": \"No\", \"TechSupport\": \"No\", \"StreamingTV\": \"No\", \"StreamingMovies\": \"No\", \"Contract\": \"Month-to-month\", \"PaperlessBilling\": \"Yes\", \"PaymentMethod\": \"Electronic check\", \"MonthlyCharges\": 29.85, \"TotalCharges\": 29.85}' ;","title":"Customer Churn"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/customer-churn/#pre-requisites","text":"First, make sure you have succesfully installed MindsDB.

In some cases, you might want to predict more than one column of your data. In order for mindsdb to predict multiple columns, you simply need to change the to_predict argument from a string (denoting the name of the column) to an array containing the names of the columns you want to predict. In the following example, we've altered the real estate model to predict the location and neighborhood both, instead of the rental_price . Code example import mindsdb_native mdb = mindsdb_native . Predictor ( name = 'multilabel_real_estate_model' ) mdb . learn ( from_data = \"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mindsdb-example-data/home_rentals.csv\" , to_predict = [ 'location' , 'neighborhood' ] # Array with the names of the columns we want to predict ) Multimedia inputs (images, audio and video) Currently, we only support images as inputs into models. We are working on support audio, you can check this issue to track the progress. Video input support is not yet planned. For any sort of media files, simply provide the full path to the file in the column. For example: [ { 'img' : '/mnt/data/img_1.jpg' 'is_bicycle' : True } ,{ 'img' : '/mnt/data/img_2.jpg' 'is_bicycle' : True } ,{ 'img' : '/mnt/data/img_3.jpg' 'is_bicycle' : False } ] Please provide the full path to a file on your local machine, not a url or the binary data from an image loaded up in a dataframe. Currently, the timeline on supporting multimedia output is still undecided, if you need that feature or want to implement, feel free to contact us. That being said, image outputs might actually work, we just haven't tested anything yet. Unbalanced dataset Given a dataset that is \"imbalanced\", the model being trained might not give the results you expect. For example, let's say you have the following dataset: data . csv x , is_power_of_9 1 , False 2 , False 3 , False 4 , False 5 , False 6 , False 7 , False 8 , False 9 , True 10 , False 11 , False . . . 81 , True 82 , False 83 , False 84 , False . . . 100 , False On which we want to predicted the aptly-named column is_power_of_9 . We have 2 occurrences of the output True and 98 occurrences of the False output. So a model could always predict False and it would have an accuracy of 98%, which is pretty decent, so unless there's a way for the model to learn those 2 instance of True without losing on accuracy, it might just decided 98% is the best possible model. However, let's say we really care about those True predictions being correct, or at least we want the model to consider them equally important, in that case we would call the learn function using the equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories argument set to true. This essentially means that a model with 50% accuracy, with 2 correct predictions for True (100%) and 48 for False (49%) is considered better than a model with 98% accuracy that only predictions False when mindsdb trains the model.

However, let's say we really care about those True predictions being correct, or at least we want the model to consider them equally important, in that case we would call the learn function using the equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories argument set to true. This essentially means that a model with 50% accuracy, with 2 correct predictions for True (100%) and 48 for False (49%) is considered better than a model with 98% accuracy that only predictions False when mindsdb trains the model. We could call this as: predictior.learn(from_data='data.csv', equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories=True)","title":"Unbalanced dataset"},{"location":"tutorials/BasicExample/","text":"This is a basic example of mindsdb_native usage in predicting the real estate prices for an area. If you want to follow out visually, watch bellow video: Goal The goal is to be able to predict the best rental_price for new properties given the information that we have in home_rentals.csv. Learning from mindsdb_native import Predictor # We tell the Predictor what column or key we want to learn and from what data Predictor ( name = 'home_rentals_price' ) . learn ( from_data = \"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mindsdb-example-data/home_rentals.csv\" , # the path to the file where we can learn from, (note: can be url) to_predict = 'rental_price' , # the column we want to learn to predict given all the data in the file ) Note : that the argument from_data can be a path to a json, csv (or other separators), excel given as a file or as a URL, or a pandas Dataframe Predicting # use the model to make predictions result = Predictor ( name = 'home_rentals_price' ) . predict ( when_data = { 'number_of_rooms' : 1 , 'initial_price' : 1222 , 'sqft' : 1190 }) # The result will be an array containing predictions for each data point (in this case only one), a confidence for said prediction and a few other extra informations print ( 'The predicted price is between $ {price} with {conf} confidence' . format ( price = result [ 0 ] . explanation [ 'rental_price' ][ 'confidence_interval' ], conf = result [ 0 ] . explanation [ 'rental_price' ][ 'confidence' ])) Notes About the Learning The first thing we can do is to learn from the csv file. Learn in the scope of MindsDB is to let it figure out a neural network that can best learn from this data as well as train and test such a model given the data that we have. When you run this script, note that it will start logging various information about the data and about the training process. This information can be useful in allowing you to figure out which parts of your data are of low quality or might contain erroneous values. About getting predictions from the model Please note the when_data argument, in this case assuming we only know that: 'number_of_rooms': 1, 'initial_price':1222 'sqft': 1190 So, as long as the columns that you pass in the when_data statement exists in the data it learned from it will work (see columns in home_rentals.csv ).

The term \u201cTA\u201d means \u201cTravel Agents\u201d and \u201cTO\u201d means \u201cTour Operators\u201d 16. is_repeated_guestValue indicating if the booking name was from a repeated guest (1) or not (0) 17. previous_cancellationsNumber of previous bookings that were cancelled by the customer prior to the current booking 18. previous_bookings_not_canceledNumber of previous bookings not cancelled by the customer prior to the current booking 19. reserved_room_typeCode of room type reserved. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons. 20. assigned_room_type Code for the type of room assigned to the booking. Sometimes the assigned room type differs from the reserved room type due to hotel operation reasons (e.g. overbooking) or by customer request. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons. 21. booking_changes Number of changes/amendments made to the booking from the moment the booking was entered on the PMS until the moment of check-in or cancellation 22. deposit_type Indication on if the customer made a deposit to guarantee the booking. This variable can assume three categories: No Deposit \u2013 no deposit was made; Non Refund \u2013 a deposit was made in the value of the total stay cost; Refundable \u2013 a deposit was made with a value under the total cost of stay. 23. agentID of the travel agency that made the booking 24. companyID of the company/entity that made the booking or responsible for paying the booking. ID is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons 25. days_in_waiting_list Number of days the booking was in the waiting list before it was confirmed to the customer 26. customer_type Type of booking, assuming one of four categories: Contract - when the booking has an allotment or other type of contract associated to it; Group \u2013 when the booking is associated to a group; Transient \u2013 when the booking is not part of a group or contract, and is not associated to other 27. transient booking; Transient-party \u2013 when the booking is transient, but is associated to at least other transient booking adrAverage Daily Rate as defined by dividing the sum of all lodging transactions by the total number of staying nights 28. required_car_parking_spaces Number of car parking spaces required by the customer 29. total_of_special_requests Number of special requests made by the customer (e.g. twin bed or high floor) 30. reservation_status Reservation last status, assuming one of three categories: Canceled \u2013 booking was canceled by the customer; Check-Out \u2013 customer has checked in but already departed; No-Show \u2013 customer did not check-in and did inform the hotel of the reason why 31. reservation_status_date Date at which the last status was set. This variable can be used in conjunction with the ReservationStatus to understand when was the booking canceled or when did the customer checked-out of the hotel","title":""},{"location":"tutorials/HotelBooking/#mindsdb-code-example","text":"import mindsdb_native import sys import pandas as pd from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score def run (): mdb = mindsdb_native .

To build a timeseries model you need to pass timeseries_settings dictionary to learn timeseries_settings = { order_by: List<String> | Mandatory window: Int | Mandatory group_by: List<String> | Optional (default: []) nr_predictions: Int | Optional (default: 1) use_previous_target: Bool | Optional (default: True) historical_columns: List<String> | Optional (default: []) } Let's go through these settings one by one: order_by - The columns based on which the data should be ordered group_by - The columns based on which to group multiple unrelated entities present in your timeseries data. For example, let's say your data consists of sequential readings from 3x sensors. Treating the problem as a timeseries makes sense for individual sensors, so you would specify: group_by=['sensor_id'] nr_predictions - The number of points in the future that predictions should be made for, defaults to 1 . Once trained, the model will be able to predict up to this many points into the future. use_previous_target - Use the previous values of the target column[s] for making predictions. Defaults to True . window - The number of rows to \"look back\" into when making a prediction, after the rows are ordered by the order_by column and split into groups. historical_columns - The temporal dynamics of these columns will be used as additional context to train the time series encoder of the predictor.

Say your columns are: date, nr_customers, store . You order by date , group by store and need to predict nr_customers . You set window=3 . You train your model and then want to make a prediction using a csv with the following content: date, nr_customers, store 2020-10-06, unknown , A1 This prediction will be less than ideal, since mindsdb doesn't know how many customers came to the store on 2020-10-05 or 2020-10-04 , which is probably the main insight the trained model is using to make predictions. So instead you need to pass a file with the following content: date, nr_customers, store 2020-10-04, 55 , A1 2020-10-05, 123 , A1 2020-10-06, None , A1 Note that mindsdb will generate a prediction for every row here (even if the target value nr_customers already exists), but you only care about the prediction for the last row, the previous 2 are there to provide historical context. Also note that, if you window was, say, equal to 5 , you would have had to provide 4 more rows instead of 2 more. Also note that, if you were to give the file: date, nr_customers, store 2020-10-04, 55 , B11 2020-10-05, 123 , A2 2020-10-06, None , A1 This wouldn't count as historical context, since you are grouping by the store column, so only rows where store is A1 will be relevant historical context for predicting a row where the store == A1 Experimental features Some features are still very experimental and have many blindspots, so if you're interested in using them please contact us so we can help and get your feedback on how to improve. Database integration When you train MindsDB from a database, it can auto-generate a query to select historical context, based on the query you used to source your training data. This can be enabled by passing advanced_args={'use_database_history': True} to the predict call (or to the SELECT call if operating from within a database). Anomaly detection We support anomaly detection for numerical time series. Our approach tags a data point as anomalous if it falls outside of the predicted range. Normally, MindsDB will try to generate bounds that are tight enough to be informative about your predictions. However, as this feature is unsupervised (because it does not need labeled anomalies in the data), we offer two parameters to tune it for any specific use case: anomaly_error_rate (Float, 0 < x < 1 ): If smaller, it leads to wider bounds, thus less sensitivity to anomalies. If bigger, it leads to narrower bounds and increased sensitivity. By default, MindsDB will try to find an appropriate value. anomaly_cooldown (Int): period during which no anomalies will be flagged, triggered after an initial anomaly is detected. Copes with potential predictor accuracy issues while it adjusts to the anomalous event. These parameters can be passed in the advanced_args dictionary when calling predict , and do not require predictor re-training.

When we think about machine learning we can think about it as a subset of Artificial Intelligence. In simple words, the idea behind machine learning is to enable machines to learn by themselves, by using small to large datasets and finding common patterns inside the data. That said, data is the core of any machine learning algorithm and having access to the data is one of the crucial steps for machine learning success. This will bring us to the second question, Where data lives these days? A great deal in databases With the increase of data in volume, variety, velocity in today's databases. Is there a better place to bring machine learning to, than being able to do machine learning right in the databases?We believe that database users meet the most important aspect of applied machine learning, which is to understand what predictive questions are important and what data is relevant to answer those questions. Additionally, adding the statistical analysis for creating the most appropriate model to that, will yield the best combination which is auto machine learning straight from the database. Bringing AutoML to those that know data best can significantly augment the capacity to solve important problems. That\u2019s why we decided to build a seamless integration with Clickhouse, in a way such that any ClickHouse user can create, train and test machine learning models with the same knowledge they have of Structured Query Language (SQL). How can we achieve this? We make use of ClickHouse\u2019s neat capabilities of accessing external tables as if they were internal tables. As such, the integration of these models is painless and transparent allowing us to: Exposing machine learning models like tables that can be queried. You simply SELECT what you want to predict and you pass in the WHERE statement the conditions for the prediction. Automatically, build, test and train machine learning models with a simple INSERT statement, where you specify what you want to learn and from what query. Why MindsDB? MindsDB is a fast-growing Open Source AutoML framework with built-in explainability - a unique visualization capability that helps better understand and trust the accuracy of predictions. With MindsDB, developers can build, train and test Machine Learning models, without needing the help of a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer. It is different from typical AutoML frameworks in that MindsDB has a strong focus on trustworthiness by means of explainability, allowing users to get valuable insights into why and how the model is reaching its predictions. Why ClickHouse? Speed and efficiency are key to ClickHouse. ClickHouse can process queries up to 100 times faster than traditional databases and is the perfect solution for Digital advertising, E-commerce, Web and App analytics, Monitoring, Telecommunications analytics. In the rest of this article, we will try to describe in detail the above points with integration between MindsDB, as an Auto-Machine Learning framework and ClickHouse, as an OLAP Database Management System. How to install MindsDB Installing MindsDB is as easy as any other Python package. All you need for installation are a Python version greater than 3.6.x and around 1 GB available disk space. Other than that you just use pip or pip3 to install it as: pip install mindsdb For more detailed installation instructions please check out installation docs. If you got an error or have any questions, please post them to our support forum community.mindsdb.com How to install ClickHouse If you already have ClickHouse installed and your analytics data saved then you\u2019re ready to start playing with MindsDB, so just skip to the Connect MindsDB to ClickHouse section.If not, ClickHouse can run on any Linux or Mac OS X with x86_64 CPU architecture. Depending on your machine check out available installation options. Once the installation is done, you can start the server as a daemon: sudo service clickhouse-server start Starting the server will not display any output, so you can execute: sudo service clickhouse-server status to check that the ClickHouse is running successfully. Next, use clickhouse-client to connect to it:clickhouse-clientIf you get Code: 516. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: default: Authentication failed: error you will need to provide the default password that you added during the installation process: clickhouse-client --password ****** That\u2019s it. You have successfully connected to your local ClickHouse server. Import dataset to ClickHouse As with any other database management system, ClickHouse also groups tables into databases. To list the available databases you can run a show databases query that will display the default databases: SHOW DATABASES; For storing the data, we will create a new database called data: CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS data; The dataset that we will use in this tutorial provides time-series air pollution measurement information from data.seoul. Let\u2019s create a table and store the data in ClickHouse. Note that you can follow up to this tutorial with different data, just edit the example queries in line with your data. CREATE TABLE pollution_measurement ( ` Measurement date ` DateTime , ` Station code ` String , Address String , Latitude Float32 , Longitude Float32 , SO2 Decimal32 ( 5 ), NO2 Decimal32 ( 5 ), O3 Decimal32 ( 5 ), CO Decimal32 ( 5 ), PM10 Decimal32 ( 1 ), ` PM2 . 5 ` Decimal32 ( 1 ) ) ENGINE = MergeTree () ORDER BY ( ` Station code ` , ` Measurement date ` ); Note that we need to use backticks to escape the special characters in the column name. The parameters added to the Decimal32(p) are the precision of the decimal digits for e.g Decimal32(5) can contain numbers from -99999.99999 to 99999.99999. The Engine = MergeTree, specify the type of the table in ClickHouse. To learn more about all of the available table engines head over to the table-engines documentation. Lastly, what we need to do is to import the data inside the pollution_measurement table: clickhouse-client --date_time_input_format=best_effort --query=\"INSERT INTO data.pollution_measurement FORMAT CSV\" < Measurement_summary.csv The --date_time_input_format=best_effort enables the datetime parser to parse the basic and all ISO 8601 date and time formats. The pollution_measurement data should be added to the data.pollution_measurement table. To make sure it is successfully added execute SELECT query: SELECT * FROM data.pollution_measurement LIMIT 5;\u200d We are halfway there! We have successfully installed MindsDB and ClickHouse and have the data saved in the database. Now, we will use MindsDB to connect to ClickHouse and train and query Machine Learning models from the air pollution measurement data. If you don\u2019t want to install ClickHouse locally, ClickHouse Docker image is a good solution. Connect MindsDB to ClickHouse Let\u2019s start MindsDB: python3 -m mindsdb --api=mysql --config=config.json The --api parameter specifies the type of API to use (mysql). The --config specifies the location of the configuration file. The minimum required configuration for connecting to ClickHouse is: { \"api\" : { \"http\" : { \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"port\" : \"47334\" }, \"mysql\" : { \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"password\" : \"password\" , \"port\" : \"47335\" , \"user\" : \"root\" } }, \"config_version\" : \"1.4\" , \"integrations\" : { \"default_clickhouse\" : { \"publish\" : true , \"host\" : \"localhost\" , \"password\" : \"pass\" , \"port\" : 8123 , \"type\" : \"clickhouse\" , \"user\" : \"default\" } }, \"storage_dir\" : \"/storage\" } In the default_clickhouse key, include the values for connecting to ClickHouse. In the storage_dir add a path to the location where MindsDB will save some configuration as (metadata and .pickle files). The Running on http://127.0.0.1:47334/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) message will be displayed if MindsDB is successfully started. That means MindsDB server is running and listening on localhost:47334.First, when MindsDB starts it creates a database and tables inside the ClickHouse. The database created is of ENGINE type MySQL(connection), where 'connection' is established from the parameters provided inside the config.json. USE mindsdb; SHOW TABLES; The default table created inside mindsdb database will be predictors where MindsDB shall keep information about the predictors(ML models), training status, accuracy, target variable and additional training options. DESCRIBE TABLE predictors; When a user creates a new model or makes a query to any table, the query is sent by MySQL text protocol to MindsDB, where it hits the MindsDB\u2019s API\u2019s responsible for training, analyzing, querying the models. Now, we have everything ready to create a model. We are going to use the data inside the pollution_measurement table to predict the Sulfur Dioxide(SO2) in the air. Creating the model is as simple as writing the INSERT query, where we will provide values for the few required attributes. Before creating the predictor make sure mindsdb database is used: use mindsdb; INSERT INTO predictors(name, predict, select_data_query) VALUES ('airq_predictor', 'SO2', 'SELECT * FROM data.pollution_measurement where SO2 > 0 ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 10000'); The Predictor in MindsDB\u2019s words means the Machine Learning model. The columns values for creating the predictor(model) are: name (string) - the name of the predictor.predict (string) - the feature you want to predict, in this example it will be SO2. select_data_query (string) - the SELECT query that will ingest the data to train the model. training_options (dictionary) - optional value that contains additional training parameters. For a full list of the parameters check the mindsdb.docs. In the background, the INSERT to predictors query will call mindsdb-native that will do a black-box analysis and start a process of extracting, analyzing, and transforming the data. It will take some time to train the model depending on the data size, columns, columns type etc, so to keep it faster we are using 5000 random columns by adding ORDERED BY rand() LIMIT 10000 to the SELECT query. You should see a message like: INSERT INTO predictors (name, predict_cols, select_data_query) VALUESOk.1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.824 sec. To check if the training of the model successfully finished, you can run: SELECT * FROM predictors WHERE name='airq_predictor'\u200d Status complete means that the model training has finished successfully. Now, let\u2019s create predictive analytics from the data by querying the created predictor. The idea was to predict the value of Sulfur Dioxide in the Seoul air station depending on the different measured parameters as NO2, O3, CO, location etc. SELECT SO2 as predicted , SO2_confidence as confidence from airq_predictor WHERE NO2 = 0 . 005 AND CO = 1 . 2 AND PM10 = 5 ; Now you can see that MindsDB predicted that the value of Sulfur Dioxide is 0.00115645 with around 98% confidence.To get additional information about the predicted value and confidence, we should include the explain column. In that case, the MindsDB\u2019s explain functionality apart from confidence can provide additional information such as prediction quality, confidence interval, missing information for improving the prediction etc. We can extend the query and include an additional column for explanation information: SELECT SO2 AS predicted , SO2_confidence AS confidence , SO2_explain AS info FROM airq_predictor WHERE ( NO2 = 0 . 005 ) AND ( CO = 1 . 2 ) AND ( PM10 = 5 ) Now we get additional information: { \"predicted_value\": 0.001156540079952395, \"confidence\": 0.9869, \"prediction_quality\": \"very confident\", \"confidence_interval\": [0.003184904620383531, 0.013975553923630717], \"important_missing_information\": [\"Station code\", \"Latitude\", \u201cO3\u201d], \"confidence_composition\": { \"CO\": 0.006 }, \"extra_insights\": { \"if_missing\": [{ \"NO2\": 0.007549311956155897 }, { \"CO\": 0.005459383721227349 }, { \"PM10\": 0.003870252306568623 }] } } By looking at the new information we can see that MindsDB is very confident about the quality of this prediction. The range of values where the predicted value lies within is determined inside the confidence interval. Also, the extra insights are providing SO2 value in a case where some of the included features (in WHERE clause) are not provided. MindsDB thinks that Station code and Latitude and O3 are very important features for more precise prediction so those values shall be included in the WHERE clause. Let\u2019s try including Station code and see the new predictions: SELECT SO2 AS predicted , SO2_confidence AS confidence FROM airq_predictor WHERE ( NO2 = 0 . 005 ) AND ( CO = 1 . 2 ) AND ( PM10 = 5 ) AND ( ` Station code ` = '32' ) AND ` PM2 . 5 `= 50 Now the predicted value has changed by adding the feature that MindsDB thought is quite important for better prediction. Additionally we can try and predict the Sulfur Dioxide in the air in some future date. What we can do is just include the Measurement date value inside WHERE clause for the specific date we want to get prediction e.g : SELECT SO2 AS predicted , SO2_confidence AS confidence FROM airq_predictor WHERE ( NO2 = 0 . 005 ) AND ( CO = 1 . 2 ) AND ( PM10 = 5 ) AND ( ` Station code ` = '32' ) AND ` PM2 . 5 `= 50 AND ` Measurement date `= \u2019 2020 - 07 - 03 00 : 01 : 00 \u2019 Or few weeks later as: At the end, the whole flow was as simple as seeing MindsDB as a database inside ClickHouse and executing queries for INSERT and SELECT directly from it. If you follow up to this tutorial with your own data, we are happy to hear about how MindsDB has come in useful to you.

When we think about machine learning we can think about it as a subset of Artificial Intelligence. In simple words, the idea behind machine learning is to enable machines to learn by themselves, by using small to large datasets and finding common patterns inside the data. That said, data is the core of any machine learning algorithm and having access to the data is one of the crucial steps for machine learning success.

Additionally, adding the statistical analysis for creating the most appropriate model to that, will yield the best combination which is auto machine learning straight from the database. Bringing AutoML to those that know data best can significantly augment the capacity to solve important problems.

Let\u2019s create a table and store the data in ClickHouse. Note that you can follow up to this tutorial with different data, just edit the example queries in line with your data. CREATE TABLE pollution_measurement ( ` Measurement date ` DateTime , ` Station code ` String , Address String , Latitude Float32 , Longitude Float32 , SO2 Decimal32 ( 5 ), NO2 Decimal32 ( 5 ), O3 Decimal32 ( 5 ), CO Decimal32 ( 5 ), PM10 Decimal32 ( 1 ), ` PM2 . 5 ` Decimal32 ( 1 ) ) ENGINE = MergeTree () ORDER BY ( ` Station code ` , ` Measurement date ` ); Note that we need to use backticks to escape the special characters in the column name.

The Running on http://127.0.0.1:47334/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) message will be displayed if MindsDB is successfully started. That means MindsDB server is running and listening on localhost:47334.First, when MindsDB starts it creates a database and tables inside the ClickHouse. The database created is of ENGINE type MySQL(connection), where 'connection' is established from the parameters provided inside the config.json. USE mindsdb; SHOW TABLES; The default table created inside mindsdb database will be predictors where MindsDB shall keep information about the predictors(ML models), training status, accuracy, target variable and additional training options. DESCRIBE TABLE predictors; When a user creates a new model or makes a query to any table, the query is sent by MySQL text protocol to MindsDB, where it hits the MindsDB\u2019s API\u2019s responsible for training, analyzing, querying the models. Now, we have everything ready to create a model. We are going to use the data inside the pollution_measurement table to predict the Sulfur Dioxide(SO2) in the air. Creating the model is as simple as writing the INSERT query, where we will provide values for the few required attributes. Before creating the predictor make sure mindsdb database is used: use mindsdb; INSERT INTO predictors(name, predict, select_data_query) VALUES ('airq_predictor', 'SO2', 'SELECT * FROM data.pollution_measurement where SO2 > 0 ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 10000'); The Predictor in MindsDB\u2019s words means the Machine Learning model. The columns values for creating the predictor(model) are: name (string) - the name of the predictor.predict (string) - the feature you want to predict, in this example it will be SO2. select_data_query (string) - the SELECT query that will ingest the data to train the model. training_options (dictionary) - optional value that contains additional training parameters. For a full list of the parameters check the mindsdb.docs. In the background, the INSERT to predictors query will call mindsdb-native that will do a black-box analysis and start a process of extracting, analyzing, and transforming the data. It will take some time to train the model depending on the data size, columns, columns type etc, so to keep it faster we are using 5000 random columns by adding ORDERED BY rand() LIMIT 10000 to the SELECT query. You should see a message like: INSERT INTO predictors (name, predict_cols, select_data_query) VALUESOk.1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.824 sec. To check if the training of the model successfully finished, you can run: SELECT * FROM predictors WHERE name='airq_predictor'\u200d Status complete means that the model training has finished successfully.

Virtual AI tables in MariaDB allows users to run Automated Machine Learning models directly from inside the database. This tutorial is an overview of this integration capability. Anyone that has dealt with Machine Learning (ML) understands that data is a fundamental ingredient to it. Given that a great deal of the world\u2019s organized data already exists inside databases, doesn\u2019t it make sense to bring machine learning capabilities straight to the database itself? To do so, we have developed a concept called AITables. In this article we want to present to you what AITables are, how you can use them in MariaDB. Invite you to try it out, get involved and to join us in the journey of ML meets MariaDB. AiTables AITables differ from normal tables in that they can generate predictions upon being queried and returning such predictions like if it was data that existed on the table. Simply put, an AI-Table allows you to use machine learning models as if they were normal database tables, in something that in plain SQL looks like this; SELECT < predicted_variable > FROM < ML_model > WHERE < conditions > To really sink in this idea, let us expand the concept through an example. The used car price example Imagine that you want to solve the problem of estimating the right price for a car on your website that has been selling used cars over the past 2 years. Also, you use MariaDB and in your database there is a table called used_cars_data where you keep records of every car you have sold so far, storing information such as: price, transmission, mileage, fuel_type, road_tax, mpg (Miles Per Gallon) and engine_size. Since you have historical data, you know that you could use Machine Learning to solve this problem. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you could simply tell your MariaDB server to do and manage the Machine Learning parts for you? At MindsDB we think so too! And AI-Tables baked into MariaDB are here to do exactly that. Although further down in this article we will guide you step by step on how to run this example yourself, let us introduce you to what you can do and how it looks in standard SQL. You can for instance with a single INSERT statement, create a machine learning model/predictor trained to predict \u2018price\u2019 using the data that lives in the table sold_cars and publish it as an AI-Table called \u2018used_cars_model\u2019. INSERT INTO mindsdb . predictors ( name , predict , select_data_query ) VALUES ( 'used_cars_model' , 'price' , ' SELECT * FROM used_cars_data ); After that you can get price predictions by querying the generated \u2018used_cars_model\u2019 AI-Table, as follows: SELECT price , confidence FROM mindsdb . used_cars_model WHERE model = \"a6\" AND mileage = 36203 AND transmission = \"automatic\" AND fueltype = \"diesel\" AND mpg = \"64.2\" AND enginesize = 2 AND year = 2016 AND tax = 20 ; As you can see with AI-Tables, we are aiming to simplify Machine Learning mechanics to simple SQL queries, so that you can focus on the important part; which is to think about what predictions are key for your business and what data you want your ML to learn from to make such predictions. By now, you might be thinking, how do I get started?, what do I need? How can I run this example in my environment? As promised, in the rest of this article we will show you step-by-step instructions on how to integrate MindsDB into your MariaDB server, how to build, test and use Machine Learning Models as AI-Tables all without the need for specific machine learning skills and how to evaluate prediction results in an \u201cExplainable AI\u201d way. If you want to preview this tutorial visually go ahead to our youtube channel and follow up the Machine Learning in MariaDB with AI Tables video. MindsDB AITables in MariaDB With MindsDB any MariaDB user can train and test neural-networks based Machine Learning models with the same knowledge they have of SQL. MindsDB is an open-source ML framework that enables running Machine Learning Models as AI-Tables. On top of that it has an exciting \u201cExplainable AI\u201d feature that allows users to get insights into their Machine Prediction accuracy score and evaluate its dependencies. For example, users can estimate how adding or removing certain data would impact on the effectiveness of the prediction. The whole integration consists of two important parts: * The Machine Learning models are exposed as database tables (AI-Tables) that can be queried with the SELECT statements. * The ML model generation and training is done through a simple INSERT statement. This is possible thanks to MariaDBs CONNECT engine, which enables us to publish tables that live outside MariaDB. Since MindsDB supports the MySQL tcp-ip protocol, AI-Tables can be plugged as if they are external MariaDB tables. The following diagram illustrates this process. The resource intensive Machine Learning tasks like model training happen on a separate MindsDB server instance or in the cloud, so that the Database performance is not affected. In the following step-by-step tutorial you will learn how to install a MindsDB server with MariaDB and connect to the data, how to train the model and get predictions using an example dataset. So let\u2019s get started. How to install MariaDB? If you already have MariaDB installed you can skip this section. MariaDB is one of the most popular database servers in the world and works on the most widely used operating systems. You can find the installation binaries and packages on the mariadb download site. To check the full list of distributions which include MariaDB head over to list of distributions . How to install MindsDB? Before you install MindsDB you need a Python version greater than 3.6 and pip >=19.3 which comes pre-installed with newer Python versions. Also, you will need to have around 1GB free space on your machine for installing the MindsDB\u2019s dependencies. Other than that the installation is quite simple. Inside your virtual environment just run: pip install mindsdb To check if the installation was successful run: pip show mindsdb And you should be able to see the MindsDB information as name, version, summary, license etc: That\u2019s all. Let\u2019s set up the required configuration and start MindsDB. Example Dataset If you are following this tutorial with your own data, you can skip to the next section. For this example we will use the Used Car Price dataset from the 100k used cars scraped data. The dataset contains information on price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size of the used cars in the UK. The idea is to predict the price depending on the above features. Add data to MariaDB The first thing we need to do is to create the table. Execute the below query: CREATE TABLE ` used_cars_data ` ( ` model ` VARCHAR ( 100 ) DEFAULT NULL , ` year ` INT ( 11 ) DEFAULT NULL , ` price ` INT ( 11 ) DEFAULT NULL , ` transmission ` VARCHAR ( 100 ) DEFAULT NULL , ` mileage ` INT ( 11 ) DEFAULT NULL , ` fueltype ` VARCHAR ( 100 ) DEFAULT NULL , ` tax ` INT ( 11 ) DEFAULT NULL , ` mpg ` FLOAT DEFAULT NULL , ` enginesize ` FLOAT DEFAULT NULL ) engine = innodb DEFAULT charset = latin1 The InnoDB is a general storage engine and the one offered as the best choice in most cases from the MariaDB team.To see the list with all available ENGINEs and for advice on which one to choose check out the MariaDB engine docs . After creating the table there are a few options that you can do to add the data inside MariaDB. If you are using graphical clients such as dbForge, DBeaver or another SQL client use the import option from the menu. Use the LOAD DATA statement that reads the local file from the location provided and sends the content to the MariaDB Server: LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'data.csv' INTO TABLE used_cars_data FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\r\\n'; The TERMINATED BY specifies the separator in the data. The escape characters and new lines are manageable with the ENCLOSED BY and LINES TERMINATED BY clause. Using mysqlimport . This is the cli for the above, LOAD DATA statement. The arguments sent here correspond to the clauses of the LOAD DATA example: mysqlimport --local --fields-terminated-by=\",\" used_cars_data data.csv Let\u2019s select the data from used_cars_data table to make sure it is successfully imported: SELECT * FROM test . used_cars_data LIMIT 5 ; The data is inside MariaDB so the next step is to add the required configuration. Required Configuration The first thing we need to set up is the required configuration for MindsDB Server. Let\u2019s create a new file called config.json and add the following example: { \"api\" : { \"http\" : { \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"port\" : \"47334\" }, \"mysql\" : { \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"password\" : \"password\" , \"port\" : \"47335\" , \"user\" : \"root\" } }, \"config_version\" : \"1.4\" , \"integrations\" : { \"default_mariadb\" : { \"publish\" : true , \"host\" : \"localhost\" , \"password\" : \"password\" , \"port\" : 3306 , \"type\" : \"mariadb\" , \"user\" : \"root\" } }, \"storage_dir\" : \"/storage\" } This looks like a big configuration file but it is quite simple. What we have included are: api \u2013 The keys here are specifying the host and port for MindsDB REST Apis. mysql \u2013 All of the information for connecting to mysql and using the mysql protocol as host, user, password and port. Also the log level information and the path to your local SSL certificate. If certificate_path is left empty, MindsDB will automatically create one. integrations \u2013 Here, we are specifying the type of integration that we will use, default_mariadb. Also the required parameters for connecting to it as host, port, user, password. Other supported databases for integrations are ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server. interface \u2013 The required keys added here are datastore and mindsdb_native, that contains the path to the storage location, which will be used by MindsDB to save some of the configuration files. And the last thing we need to do is to install the CONNECT storage engine plugin that we have added in the plugin-load-add variable. To check how to download it for your OS check installing docs. It should be quite simple as using the package manager, e.g: sudo apt - get install mariadb - plugin - connect That\u2019s pretty much everything related to the configuration required for successful integration with MariaDB. Let\u2019s jump to the interesting part where we will train the machine learning model and query it. AutoML inside MariaDB First, we need to start MindsDB: python3 -m mindsdb --api=mysql --config=config.json The flags added here are: \u2013api \u2013 This specifies the type of API we will use with MindsDB, in this case mysql. \u2013config \u2013 The path to the config.json file we have created before. If MindsDB was successfully started there should be a new database automatically created in MariaDB called mindsdb with two tables (commands and predictors). In these tables, MindsDB will keep information about the models, model accuracy, training status, target variable that we will predict and additional options used for model training. Create new predictor The main motto when we first started MindsDB was with one line of code, so now we will try to stick to it and present that in the databases with just one query. The Predictor in MindsDB\u2019s words means Machine Learning model, so creating one could be done with an INSERT statement inside mindsdb.predictors table. Execute the following query: INSERT INTO mindsdb . predictors ( name , predict , select_data_query ) VALUES ( 'used_cars_model' , 'price' , ' SELECT * FROM used_cars_data ); What this query does is it creates a new model called \u2018used_cars_model\u2019 , specifies the column that we will try to predict as \u2018price\u2019 from the used_cars_data table. The required columns(parameters) for training the predictor are: name (string) \u2013 the name of the predictor. predict (string) \u2013 the feature you want to predict, in this example it will be price. select_data_query (string) \u2013 the SELECT query that will get the data from MariaDB. training_options (dictionary) \u2013 optional value that contains additional training parameters. For a full list of the parameters check the mindsdb.docs. You should see the message about the successful execution of the query and if you open up the console, the MindsDB logger shall display messages while training the model. Training could take some time depending on the data used, columns types, size etc. In our example not more than 2-3 min. To check that model was successfully trained run: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'used_cars_model' The column status shall be complete and the model accuracy will be saved when the training finishes. The model has been trained successfully. It was quite simple because we didn\u2019t do any hyperparameters tuning or features engineering and leave that out to MindsDB as an AutoML framework to try and fit the best model. With the INSERT query, we just provided labeled data as an input. The next step is to query the trained model with SELECT and get the output from it (predict the price of the car). Query the predictor To get the prediction from the model is as easy as executing the SELECT statement where we will select the price and price confidence. The main idea is to predict the used car\u2019s price depending on the different features. The first thing that comes to mind when looking for the used car is the car model, fuel type, mileage, the year when the car was produced etc. We should include in the WHERE clause all of this informations and leave it to MindsDB to make the predictions for them e.g: SELECT price AS predicted , price_confidence AS confidence FROM mindsdb . used_cars_model WHERE model = \"a6\" AND mileage = 36203 AND transmission = \"automatic\" AND fueltype = \"diesel\" AND mpg = \"64.2\" AND enginesize = 2 AND year = 2016 AND tax = 20 ; You should see that MindsDB is quite confident that the car with all of the above characteristics as included in the WHERE clause shall cost around 13,111. To get additional information about the prediction include the explain column in the SELECT e.g: SELECT price AS predicted , price_confidence AS confidence , price_explain AS info FROM mindsdb . used_cars_model WHERE model = \"a6\" AND mileage = 36203 AND transmission = \"automatic\" AND fueltype = \"diesel\" AND mpg = \"64.2\" AND enginesize = 2 AND year = 2016 AND tax = 20 ; Note that to beautify the resultFormat you can add command line option format for particular session. Now MindsDB will display additional information in the info column as prediction quality, confidence interval, missing information for improving the prediction etc. { \"predicted_value\" : 13772 , \"confidence\" : 0.9922 , \"prediction_quality\" : \"very confident\" , \"confidence_interval\" : [ 10795 , 31666 ], \"important_missing_information\" : [], \"confidence_composition\" : { \"Model\" : 0.008 , \"year\" : 0.018 , \"transmission\" : 0.001 , \"mpg\" : 0.001 }, \"extra_insights\" : { \"if_missing\" : [{ \"Model\" : 13661 }, { \"year\" : 17136 }, { \"transmission\" : 3405 }, { \"mileage\" : 15281 }, { \"fuelType\" : 7877 }, { \"tax\" : 13908 }, { \"mpg\" : 38858 }, { \"engineSize\" : 13772 }] } } The confidence_interval specifies the probability that the value of a price lies within the range of 10k to 30k. The important_missing_information in this case is empty, but if we omit some of the important values in the WHERE clause e.g price, year or mpg, MindsDB shall warn us that that column is important for the model. The if_missing in the extra_insights shows the price value if some of the mentioned columns are missing. Now, let\u2019s try and get the price prediction for different car models with different fuel type, mileage, engine size, transmission: SELECT price AS predicted , price_confidence AS confidence , price_explain AS info FROM mindsdb . used_cars_model WHERE model = \"a1\" AND mileage = 122946 AND transmission = \"manual\" AND fueltype = \"petrol\" AND mpg = \"35.4\" AND enginesize = 1 . 4 AND year = 2014 AND tax = 30 ; Now, MindsDB thinks that this type of car would cost around 12k and price ranges to 23k. Let\u2019s sum up what we did and the simple steps we take to get the predictions: Install MariaDB and MindsDB. Setup the configuration. Train the model with an INSERT query. Get predictions from the model with a SELECT query. Quite simple right? This is a brand new feature that we have developed so we are happy to hear your opinions on it. You can play around and query the model with different values or train and query the model with different datasets.

Given that a great deal of the world\u2019s organized data already exists inside databases, doesn\u2019t it make sense to bring machine learning capabilities straight to the database itself? To do so, we have developed a concept called AITables. In this article we want to present to you what AITables are, how you can use them in MariaDB.

Since you have historical data, you know that you could use Machine Learning to solve this problem. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you could simply tell your MariaDB server to do and manage the Machine Learning parts for you? At MindsDB we think so too! And AI-Tables baked into MariaDB are here to do exactly that. Although further down in this article we will guide you step by step on how to run this example yourself, let us introduce you to what you can do and how it looks in standard SQL. You can for instance with a single INSERT statement, create a machine learning model/predictor trained to predict \u2018price\u2019 using the data that lives in the table sold_cars and publish it as an AI-Table called \u2018used_cars_model\u2019. INSERT INTO mindsdb . predictors ( name , predict , select_data_query ) VALUES ( 'used_cars_model' , 'price' , ' SELECT * FROM used_cars_data ); After that you can get price predictions by querying the generated \u2018used_cars_model\u2019 AI-Table, as follows: SELECT price , confidence FROM mindsdb . used_cars_model WHERE model = \"a6\" AND mileage = 36203 AND transmission = \"automatic\" AND fueltype = \"diesel\" AND mpg = \"64.2\" AND enginesize = 2 AND year = 2016 AND tax = 20 ; As you can see with AI-Tables, we are aiming to simplify Machine Learning mechanics to simple SQL queries, so that you can focus on the important part; which is to think about what predictions are key for your business and what data you want your ML to learn from to make such predictions. By now, you might be thinking, how do I get started?, what do I need? How can I run this example in my environment? As promised, in the rest of this article we will show you step-by-step instructions on how to integrate MindsDB into your MariaDB server, how to build, test and use Machine Learning Models as AI-Tables all without the need for specific machine learning skills and how to evaluate prediction results in an \u201cExplainable AI\u201d way.

For example, users can estimate how adding or removing certain data would impact on the effectiveness of the prediction. The whole integration consists of two important parts: * The Machine Learning models are exposed as database tables (AI-Tables) that can be queried with the SELECT statements. * The ML model generation and training is done through a simple INSERT statement. This is possible thanks to MariaDBs CONNECT engine, which enables us to publish tables that live outside MariaDB. Since MindsDB supports the MySQL tcp-ip protocol, AI-Tables can be plugged as if they are external MariaDB tables. The following diagram illustrates this process.

How to install MindsDB If you already have MindsDB installed, you can skip this section. MindsDB is a cross-platform tool and can be installed on the most widely used OSs: Windows, Linux and macOS. Also, there are few other options to get MindsDB, such as through Docker, installing from source code or using PyPi. To get started, check the following list, and use the option that works best for you: Windows Linux MacOS Docker Source install How to install Microsoft SQL Server Head over to the official SQL Server installation guide on Microsoft docs for Windows. If you want to use the cloud version, check out this documentation . Prerequisite For this integration to work, you must make sure that the Microsoft SQL Server has MSDASQL installed, which currently only works on Windows machines. If not, you can download it here . Example dataset In this tutorial, we will use the Medical Cost Personal dataset from Kaggle. The data contains medical information and costs billed by health insurance companies. There are 1338 observations and 7 variables in this dataset: age: age of the primary beneficiary sex: insurance contractor gender \u2013 female, male bmi: body mass index - an objective index of body weight (kg / m2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 children: number of children covered by health insurance / number of dependents smoker: smoker? region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US \u2013 northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest charges: individual medical costs billed by the health insurance. The end result that we will try to achieve is to accurately predict insurance costs per beneficiary. Import dataset to Microsoft SQL Server If you are following this tutorial with your own data, you can skip this section. The first thing we need to do before importing the dataset is to create a new table called insurance : CREATE TABLE insurance ( age int NULL , sex varchar ( 100 ) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL , bmi numeric ( 18 , 0 ) NULL , children int NULL , smoker varchar ( 100 ) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL , region varchar ( 100 ) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL , charges numeric ( 18 , 0 ) NULL ) GO ; To import the dataset there are a few options available. If you are using SQL Management Studio or any other database management GUI, use the import from CSV option. If you are following this tutorial using a SQL client, you can use the BULK INSERT statement: BULK INSERT insurance FROM 'insurance.csv' WITH ( FORMAT = 'CSV' , FIELDQUOTE = '\"' , FIRSTROW = 2 , FIELDTERMINATOR = ',' , -- the insurance.csv delimiter ROWTERMINATOR = '\\n' , TABLOCK ) Now, the data should be inside the insurance table. To make sure it was successfully imported, SELECT one row from the created table: SELECT TOP ( 1 ) * FROM insurance ; Connect MindsDB and Microsoft SQL Server We have installed MindsDB and imported the data, so the next step is to create the integration. When you start MindsDB, it should automatically run the MindsDB Studio (Graphical User Interface) at the http://127.0.0.1:47334/ address in your browser. We can use the Studio to connect MindsDB and Microsoft SQL server: From the left navigation menu, select Database Integration. Click on the ADD DATABASE button. In the Connect to Database modal window: Select Microsoft SQL Server as the Supported Database. Add the Database name. Add the Host name. Add Port. Add SQL Server user. Add Password for SQL Server user. Click on check connection to test the connection. Click on CONNECT . The next step is to create a new datasource by selecting the data from the insurance table. Click on the NEW DATASOURCE button, and add the SELECT query in the Query input: SELECT * FROM insurance; We have created a new datasource InsuranceData . What we did through the MindsDB Studio can also be done by extending the default configuration of the MindsDB Server. To learn more about how to do that, see the mssql-client docs. Train new model The connection between the MindsDB and Microsoft SQL Server is done, so the next step is to train the model. Training a new model is done by inserting into the mindsdb.predictors table. The required parameters that the INSERT query should have are: name (string) -- The name of the machine learning model that we will train. predict (string) -- The column (feature) that we want to get predictions for. select_data_query (string) -- The SELECT query that will select the data used for training. In this example we will train new model called insurance_model that predicts the charges from the insurance table, so the model training query looks like this: exec ( 'INSERT INTO mindsdb.predictors (name, predict, select_data_query) VALUES (\"insurance_model\", \"charges\", \"SELECT * FROM insurance\")' ) AT mindsdb ; If you are wondering why we are using the exec command to wrap the INSERT statement, that's because it's one of the ways to query a linked server from Microsoft SQL Server. An alternate option is to use openquery , which will execute the specified INSERT query on the server. In this example the query looks like this: INSERT openquery ( mindsdb , 'SELECT name, predict, select_data_query FROM mindsdb.predictors WHERE 1=0' ) VALUES ( 'insurance_model' , 'charges' , 'SELECT * FROM insurance' ); Now, in the background, the training has started. MindsDB will do a black-box analysis and start a process of extracting, analyzing, and transforming the data. The time it takes to train a model differs depending on dataset size, the number of features, feature types, etc. To check if the model training has successfully finished, we can SELECT from the mindsdb.predictors table as: exec ( 'SELECT * FROM mindsdb.predictors' ) AT mindsdb ; The query will return the status of the model as complete , or if the training is still running as training . Make predictions (Query the model) Once the model training finishes we can query that model. Querying the model can be done by executing the SELECT statement from the models AI Table . Let's try and query the insurance_model that we have created. The prediction that we will do is to get insurance for the beneficiary that is 30 years old, has 27.9 as a body mass index and has 1 child. All of these parameters should be added inside the WHERE clause. exec ( 'SELECT charges AS predicted, charges_confidence AS confidence, charges_explain AS info FROM mindsdb.insurance_model WHERE age=30 AND bmi=27.9 AND children=1' ) AT mindsdb ; To get the insurance cost, confidence in that cost, and additional information from MindsDB, we did a SELECT for charges , charges_confidence , and charges_explain . The response from MindsDB should look like this: predic te d | 9421.233985124825 co nf ide n ce | 0.86 i nf o | { \"predicted_value\" : 9421.233985124825 , \"confidence\" : 0.86 , \"prediction_quality\" : \"very confident\" , \"confidence_interval\" : [ 6603.107461750912 , 12239.36050849874 ], \"important_missing_information\" : [ \"smoker\" ] } MindsDB thinks that for this beneficiary, the insurance cost should be 9,421, with 86% confidence for this prediction. The charges cost interval could vary from 6,603 to 12,239, depending on the beneficiary. As the important information for improving this prediction, MindsDB thinks that providing information about smoker is very important. Conclusion We have seen how easy it is to train and query models directly from a Microsoft SQL database. In short, the flow that we covered was: Connect to Microsoft SQL Server using MindsDB Studio integrations dashboard. Create a new datasource by SELECT ing from the table. Train new model by INSERT ing in mindsdb.predictors table. Get predictions by SELECT ing from the model.

In this example we will train new model called insurance_model that predicts the charges from the insurance table, so the model training query looks like this: exec ( 'INSERT INTO mindsdb.predictors (name, predict, select_data_query) VALUES (\"insurance_model\", \"charges\", \"SELECT * FROM insurance\")' ) AT mindsdb ; If you are wondering why we are using the exec command to wrap the INSERT statement, that's because it's one of the ways to query a linked server from Microsoft SQL Server. An alternate option is to use openquery , which will execute the specified INSERT query on the server. In this example the query looks like this: INSERT openquery ( mindsdb , 'SELECT name, predict, select_data_query FROM mindsdb.predictors WHERE 1=0' ) VALUES ( 'insurance_model' , 'charges' , 'SELECT * FROM insurance' ); Now, in the background, the training has started. MindsDB will do a black-box analysis and start a process of extracting, analyzing, and transforming the data.

Check out the official MySQL documentation to see how to do that. The last step is to create the MindsDB configuration file. MindsDB will try to use the default configuration options like host, port or username for MySQL. If you want to extend these or change the default values, you need to add a config.json file. Create a new file config.json and include the following information: { \"api\" : { \"http\" : { \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"port\" : \"47334\" }, \"mysql\" : { \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"password\" : \"password\" , \"port\" : \"47335\" , \"user\" : \"root\" } }, \"config_version\" : \"1.4\" , \"integrations\" : { \"default_mysql\" : { \"publish\" : true , \"host\" : \"localhost\" , \"password\" : \"root\" , \"port\" : 3307 , \"type\" : \"mysql\" , \"user\" : \"root\" } }, \"storage_dir\" : \"/storage\" } The values provided in the configuration file are: api['http\u2019] -- This key is used for starting the MindsDB HTTP server by providing: host(default 127.0.0.1) - The mindsDB server address. port(default 47334) - The mindsDB server port. api['mysql'] -- This key is used for database integrations that work through MySQL protocol.

So, MindsDB thinks that the value for consumption rate is around 0.87 with high confidence (97%). There is additional information that we can get back from MindsDB by selecting the explain column from the model: SELECT satisfaction AS predicted , satisfaction_confidence AS confidence , satisfaction_explain AS info FROM mindsdb . passenger_satisfaction_model WHERE \"Customer Type\" = 'Loyal Customer' AND age = 52 AND \"Type of Travel\" = 'Business travel' AND \"Class\" = 'Eco' ; Now, apart from the predicted and confidence values, MindsDB will return additional Information in JSON format in the explain column: { \"predicted_value\" : \"satisfied\" , \"confidence\" : 0.94 , \"prediction_quality\" : \"very confident\" , \"important_missing_information\" : [ \"Flight Distance\" , \"Inflight wifi service\" , \"Online boarding\" , \"Baggage handling\" ], \"confidence_composition\" : { \"age\" : 0.935 }, \"extra_insights\" : { \"if_missing\" : [{ \"Customer Type\" : \"satisfied\" }, { \"Type of Travel\" : \"satisfied\" }, { \"Class\" : \"satisfied\" }] } } The confidence_interval shows a possible range of values in which consumption lies. The important_missing_information shows the list of features that MindsDB thinks are quite important for better prediction, in this case, the \u201cFlight Distance\u201d, \"Inflight wifi service\", \"Online boarding\" and \"Baggage handling\". The extra_insights shows a list of rows that we have included in the WHERE clause and shows what the consumption value would be if some of those were missing.

Given that a great deal of the world\u2019s organized data already exists inside databases, doesn't it make sense to bring machine learning capabilities straight to the database itself? Bringing Machine Learning to those who know their data best can significantly augment the capacity to solve important problems. To do so, we have developed a concept called AI-Tables.","title":"AI-Tables in PostgreSQL - get neural-network-based predictions using simple SQL queries"},{"location":"tutorials/postgresql/#what-are-ai-tables","text":"AI-Tables differ from normal tables in that they can generate predictions upon being queried and can return such predictions as if they were data that existed in the table.

Please check the EnterpriseDB documentation on how to do that. The last step is to create the MindsDB configuration file. MindsDB will try to use the default configuration options like host, port, and username for the PostgreSQL integration. If you want to extend these or change the default values, you need to add a config.json file. Create a new file config.json, and include the following information: { \"api\" : { \"http\" : { \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"port\" : \"47334\" }, \"mysql\" : { \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"password\" : \"password\" , \"port\" : \"47335\" , \"user\" : \"root\" } }, \"config_version\" : \"1.4\" , \"integrations\" : { \"default_postgres\" : { \"database\" : \"postgres\" , \"publish\" : true , \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"password\" : \"postgres\" , \"port\" : 5432 , \"type\" : \"postgres\" , \"user\" : \"postgres\" } }, \"storage_dir\" : \"/storage\" } The values provided in the configuration file are: api['http\u2019] -- This key is used for starting the MindsDB HTTP server by providing: host(default 127.0.0.1) - The mindsDB server address. port(default 47334) - The mindsDB server port. api['mysql'] -- This key is used for database integrations that work through MySQL protocol.

If everything works as expected, you should see the following message: Upon successful setup, MindsDB should create a new schema called mindsdb.

It can be done by executing the INSERT query inside the mindsdb.predictors table.

The required columns (parameters) added in the INSERT for training the predictor are: name (string) - the name of the predictor. predict (string) - the feature you want to predict, in this example it will be satisfaction. select_data_query (string) - the SELECT query that will get the data from PostgreSQL. training_options (dictionary) - optional value that contains additional training parameters. For a full list of parameters, check the PredictorInterface . To check that the training finished successfully, we can SELECT from the mindsdb.predictors table and get the status: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'passenger_satisfaction_model' ; A status of \u201ccomplete\u201d means that training successfully finished. Now, let\u2019s query the model. The trained model behaves like an AI Table and can be queried as if it were a standard database table.
